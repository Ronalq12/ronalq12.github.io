        <h3> <img src="images/ico_epingle.png" alt=""> I AM A GREAT TRAVELLER</h3>

        <p>"I will never forget my trip to Budapest five years ago. No one in my family wanted to go on a trip with me because I like to take lots of pictures and I make them stop (or wait) every 5 minutes. Well, since my trip to Budapest they have not complained
            again and it is because on this trip we rented a car to visit the center since we were staying almost an hour from the city center. My father was looking for parking for a long time and finally we parked the car in an alley very close to the
            famous Chain Bridge.</p>

        <p>We were all tired of going around so once we were parked we all left the car running. After visiting the city, all tired, we returned to where we had parked. It was easy, with the reference bridge, in theory we did not have to find it hard to
            find it ... but it was not like that! We spent more than an hour wandering around to find it since all the alleys seemed the same and with names that were impossible to pronounce.</p>
        <p>In a moment of desperation, I sat on a sidewalk and began to review the photographs I had been doing that day. It occurred to me to pull back in order to photograph the path we had taken that day, but in reverse and suddenly I had a picture with
            the name of the street! ... Obviously my family has not complained about my love for photography and now I am obliged to do one whenever we park.... In a moment of desperation, I sat on a sidewalk and began to review the photographs I had
